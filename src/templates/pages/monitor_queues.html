                            Flower is a powerful web-based Celery monitoring tool designed to keep track of our
                            tasks.
                            Admins may view the state of which tasks were run, with what arguments, and many more
                            features. Here you may also view which queues your celery workers are consuming, and the
                            state of any tasks in them. At last, there is also a great monitoring page for viewing
                            the
                            systemic impact of your workers.
