[Codabench](https://codabench.org) is an upgraded version of the [CodaLab Competitions](https://codalab.lisn.fr/) platform, allowing you to create either **competitions** or **benchmarks**. A benchmark is essentially an **ever-lasting competition** with **multiple tasks**, for which a participant can make **multiple entries** in the result table.

This getting started tutorial shows a **simple example** of how to create a competition. Advanced users should check [fancier examples](https://github.com/codalab/competition-examples/tree/master/codabench) and [the full documentation](https://github.com/codalab/codabench/wiki). If you simply wish to participate in a benchmark or competition, go to [Participating in a benchmark](../../Participants/User_Participating-in-a-Competition.md).

## Getting ready

- Create a [Codabench](https://codabench.org) account (if not done yet)
- Download the [sample competition bundle](https://github.com/codalab/competition-examples/blob/master/codabench/wheat_seeds/code_submission_bundle.zip) and the [sample submission](https://github.com/codalab/competition-examples/blob/master/codabench/wheat_seeds/sample_code_submission.zip).
- Do not unzip them.

## Create a competition
- From the front page of [Codabench](https://codabench.org), in the top menu, go to the **Benchmark > Management** 
- Click the green **Upload** button at the top right.
- Upload the (zipped) sample competition bundle => this will create your competition.

## Make changes
-  Click on the **Edit** gray button at the top to enter the editor.
- Make small changes
    - Change the logo in the **Details** tab to another png of jpg file.
    - Change the end date in the **Phases** tab: if the competition is terminated, you will not be able to make submissions.
- Save your changes and verify that they have become effective.

## Make a submission
- In your competition page, go to the tab **My submissions**
- Submit the (zipped) sample submission bundle you downloaded.
- When your submission finishes, go to the **Result tab** to check if it shows up on the leaderboard.
!!! warning "In some competitions, submissions successfully processed do not automatically get pushed to the leaderboard"

## Publish your competition
- If you want to make your competition visible to all, you must publish it by checking the **Publish** box at the very bottom of the editor **Details** page.
- After you publish your competition, it should now be visible when you are not logged in, at the URL of your competition page.
