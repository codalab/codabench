## Documentation

Welcome to the Codabench wiki!

Codabench is a platform allowing you to flexibly specify a benchmark. First you define tasks, e.g. datasets and metrics of success, then you specify the API for submissions of code (algorithms), add some documentation pages, and "CLICK!" your benchmark is created, ready to accept submissions of new algorithms. Participant results get appended to an ever-growing leaderboard.

You may also create inverted benchmarks in which the role of datasets and algorithms are swapped. You specify reference algorithms and your participants submit datasets.
