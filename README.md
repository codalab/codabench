## What is Codabench?

Codabench is an open-source web-based platform that enables researchers, developers, and data scientists to collaborate, with the goal of advancing research fields where machine learning and advanced computation is used. Codabench helps to solve many common problems in the arena of data-oriented research through its online community where people can share worksheets and participate in competitions and benchmarks. It can be seen as a version 2 of [CodaLab Competitions](https://github.com/codalab/codalab-competitions).

To see Codabench in action, visit [codabench.org](https://www.codabench.org/).

## Quick installation (for Linux)

_To participate, or even organize your own benchmarks or competitions, **you don't need to install anything**, you just need to sign in an instance of the platform (e.g. [this one](https://www.codabench.org/)). 
If you wish to configure your own instance of Codabench platform, here are the instructions:_


```
$ cp .env_sample .env
$ docker compose up -d
$ docker compose exec django ./manage.py migrate
$ docker compose exec django ./manage.py generate_data
$ docker compose exec django ./manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

You can now login as username "admin" with password "admin" at http://localhost/

If you ever need to reset the database, use the script `./reset_db.sh`

For more information about installation, checkout [Codabench Basic Installation Guide](https://github.com/codalab/codabench/wiki/Codabench-Installation) and [How to Deploy Server](https://github.com/codalab/codabench/wiki/How-to-deploy-Codabench-on-your-server).
