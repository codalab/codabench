                            <p>Codabench is a platform allowing you to flexibly specify a benchmark. First you define tasks, e.g. datasets and metrics of success, then you specify the API for submissions of code (algorithms), add some documentation pages, and [CLICK] your benchmark is created, ready to accept submissions of new algorithms. Participant results get appended to an ever-growing leaderboard.</p>
                            <p>You may also create inverted benchmarks in which the role of datasets and algorithms are swapped. You specify reference algorithms and your participants submit datasets.</p>

                            <p>Codalab was created in 2013 as a joint venture between Microsoft and Stanford University.
                                Originally the vision was to create an ecosystem for conducting computational research
                                in a more
                                efficient, reproducible, and collaborative manner, combining worksheets and
                                competitions.
                                Worksheets capture complex research pipelines in a reproducible way and create
                                "executable
                                papers". Currently, we are developing the V2 of Codalab, which will be able to organize benchmarks.</p>
                            <p>Some competitions have been organized using worksheets, but the competition platform
                                and the worksheet platform have both a large user base and can be used independently. In
                                2014,

                            <p>Since 2016, Codalab offers the possibility of organizing machine learning challenges with
                                code
                                submission. The simplest machine learning challenges require only the submission of
                                results,
                                which are compared to a solution (or key) by a scoring program. Result submission
                                challenges are
                                less computationally expensive than code submission challenges. However, they offer less
                                possibilities. In particular, code submission allows conducting fair benchmarks by
                                executing
                                submitted code in the same condition for all participants.</p>
                            <p>Codalab has been providing free resources for challenge organizers who want to run high
                                impact
                                events, within a pre-approved agreed upon budget. New since version 1.5: organizers can
                                hook up
                                their own compute workers to the backend of Codalab to redirect the code submissions,
                                enabling
                                growth to big data competitions running at the expense of the organizers. For very
                                special
                                dedicated projects, Codalab can be customized since it is an open source project.</p>
