# About CodaLab and Codabench

CodaLab is an open-source platform that provides an ecosystem for conducting computational research in a more efficient, reproducible, and collaborative manner.

**CodaLab Worksheets** allow you to capture complex research pipelines in a reproducible way and create "executable papers". Use any data format or programming language — great for the power user! CodaLab worksheets has a [public instance](https://worksheets.codalab.org/) hosted by Stanford University.

**CodaLab Competitions** bring together the entire community to tackle the most challenging data and computational problems today. You can win prizes and also create your own competition. CodaLab Competitions has a [public instance](https://codalab.lisn.fr/) hosted by Université Paris-Saclay. [Click here](https://github.com/codalab/codalab-competitions/wiki/Statistics-of-the-public-servers) for statistics about the growth and activity of the public servers.

**CodaBench** offers hosting competitions and benchmarks on virtually any data science problem. Building upon the capabilities of CodaLab Competitions, it introduces additional features and enhanced performance. Codabench has a [public instance](https://www.codabench.org/) hosted by Université Paris-Saclay. The code is [open-source](https://github.com/codalab/codabench).
